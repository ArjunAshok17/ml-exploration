# ML Explorations #
In an effort to get more acquainted with different classes of models [regression, 
neural networks, trees, etc.], different mediums [graph data, text, images, etc.], 
different tasks [time-series prediction, classification], I'm making this repo to 
track all my work.

Datasets contains all the raw data I'll be using, but this will likely be 
processed in some way before use in the modeling. Caches for this processed data 
will be within each modeling exploration for ease of use, although they'll not be 
uploaded due to size constraints.
